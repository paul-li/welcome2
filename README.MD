# Welcome Developers

If you are reading this, then that means SPE has deemed you worthy enough to develop software for us.

If you are here due to migration of SPE GitHub Enterprise Servers, please refer to the [migration doc](MIGRATION.MD) to assist you in reconfiguring your local git workspace to reach the migrated repositories.

Refer to [Personal Access Tokens](PATS.MD) to set those up.
